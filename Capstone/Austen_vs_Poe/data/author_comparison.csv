"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.",Austen
"However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.",Austen
"“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”",Austen
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.,Austen
"“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.”",Austen
Mr. Bennet made no answer.,Austen
“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.,Austen
"“You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”",Austen
This was invitation enough.,Austen
"“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.”",Austen
“What is his name?”,Austen
“Bingley.”,Austen
“Is he married or single?”,Austen
"“Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”",Austen
“How so? How can it affect them?”,Austen
"“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”",Austen
"It was in the blue room where stood the prince, with a group of pale courtiers by his side",Poe
"At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker",Poe
"But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince's person; and, while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purple --through the purple to the green --through the green to the orange --through this again to the white --and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him",Poe
"It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all",Poe
"He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer",Poe
"There was a sharp cry --and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterwards, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero",Poe
"Then, summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave-cerements and corpse-like mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible form",Poe
And now was acknowledged the presence of the Red Death,Poe
He had come like a thief in the night,Poe
"And one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their revel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall",Poe
And the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay,Poe
And the flames of the tripods expired,Poe
And Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all,Poe
